# SalesDataAnalysis
##### In the following notebook we analyze a Sales Data Set.
In 2020 data is of extreme value, just take a look at F.A.N.G companies, they have made thier fortunes from it. Industries where data is created cannot afford to ignore it. The only right choice for them is to find new ways to use data for their benefit. The analysis of the data is where value can be both extracted and refined.
In this project we do the first steps for the devolpment of Future Sales Predictions, Churn Prevention, and Cross-sell Recommendations, among others.

## Context
Without any doubt, data science brings its positive effects to all industries. Any industry can benefit from data-based, well-structured and highly-accurate decisions. The sales industry actively applies data science solutions for its benefit. The innovations that Data Science brings to sales mostly improve customer experience and as a result boost sales. Sales KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and ROI (Return on Investment) may be enhanced with fewer efforts as well. Of course, to achieve this objective a great deal of data collection, processing, cleansing will be needed, but it is definitely worth the effort.

The correct analysis of sales data can help us:
#### Organize
Data can help organize the next set of opportunities to focus on that may increase chances of incrementing sales and income. Algorithms can also assist in research and communication with other areas in the organization and help us plan timely followups — that can turn a lost opportunity into a potential one.
#### Decide
Algorithms can help sales representatives decide between which product to suggest to the potential customer , when to recommend a product, a what hour, or what discount percentages would increase likelihood of a sale — and doing in real-time while still on that call.
#### Act
Data can suggest not only the best opportunities to work on, but the next set of actions to take that improve the conversion rates — akin to a turn-by-turn GPS for sales professionals.
#### Optimize
Where is the next 10% improvement in revenue coming from? This is a question that is on every manager’s mind. Does it involve re-assessing the performance of lead-sources, or re-arranging workloads of the reps? Whatever your strategy is, data can help, with consistency.
#### Drive Insights
Guide your team with data supported insights and not just by gut feel or even worse, none.


## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn(https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `SalesDataAnalysis.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory SalesDataAnalysis.ipynb/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook aSalesDataAnalysis.ipynb.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook aSalesDataAnalysis.ipynb.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The datasets used in this project is included in the folder `files`.
